                    <h3>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h3>
                    <p>
                        Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge,
                        and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules,
                        behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what
                        stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued
                        , we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that
                        *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and
                        companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change 
                        your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost
                        impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
                    </p>

                    <h3>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination
                         of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s
                          job to put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques
                           that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce 
                           the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand 
                        on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools
                         used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll
                          consider why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.
                    </p>
                    <h3>ABOUT ADAM</h3>
                    <p>
                        Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration,
                         communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director
                          with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience
                           design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective
                            and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian
                             a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its
                              success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and discussingdesign.com.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries like jQuery,
                         AngularJS, Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure that our code is 
                         ready for production? This talk will share tips on how writing tests can be
                          written easily and quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.

                    <h3>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h3>
                    <p>
                        Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
                         Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you 
                         to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding
                          basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and
                           JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration
                            and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes.
                             Long live rapid prototyping.
